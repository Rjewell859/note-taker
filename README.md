## Description

This is a note-taking application with two pages, a landing page and a notes page. When the user clicks the "Get Started" button, they are taken to the notes page where they can either view a note or delete a note from the left hand column. From the right hand side of the page the user can add, write, and save notes. Each note has both a title and a body. The notes are stored in a json object and will persist on the site.

### Usage

To use the application click on the "Get Started" button and then click the plus sign to begin writing a note. It is required to include a title and a body for the note to be saved.
